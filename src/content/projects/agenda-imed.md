title1: 'Challenge'
content2: 'Generate visual and functional consistency between the different software managed by I-Med, through a single platform that allows the management of doctors, scheduling, and call-center support. This will facilitate the health processes and procedures of individuals and institutions.'
title2: 'Progress'
content3: 'User flows were created for the information architecture stage in order to know the paths that the user would commonly take and thus be able to build the organization, search, and navigation system of the platform that will finally allow users to complete the tasks, find what they need and understand what they have found. The wireframes and mockups were worked aligned with the data provided in the architecture stage. The size of this software made it imperative to create a design system that would allow visual coherence in all views. Design systems such as Polaris and Ant Design were used as references.'
